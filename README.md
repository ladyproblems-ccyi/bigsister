Intro - Charles

Our project is inspired by the theme of Culture and by the Proctor & Gamble initiaive. We've all had those moments where we've felt overcome with the weight of some problem, reluctant to discuss it with anyone, trying to deal with it all on our own, and when we finally build up the courage to vent our problems to a listening ear....we can finally exhale and begin to solve our problem while feeling supported and in a more relaxed state of mind.

This is Sister - 1-tap and you're connected to an anynomous community of supportive women whom are familiar with the unique and sensitive issues that women experience throughout their lives. Because sometimes it's easier to talk to a complete stranger.

With topics ranging from sexual health, to aging, to careers, and motherhood; Sister supports women's confidence by fostering a community where there's always someone available to chat, or simply listen.

Question Topics:


  Target Audience - Iga

  How is this different from other similar applications? - Iga


  How will this be sustainable? -Claudia

    -Our value is the wealth of anonymized data from the voice and text conversations. It potential uses include:
    -Finding patterns in the seasonality of certain topics or trends.    -Identify sentimient analysis for a given topic, brand, or product

    -P&G rep suggests that the threshold for this type of data becoming valuable is 100,000 regular conversations.

  Next Steps - Charles
